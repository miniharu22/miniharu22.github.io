<h2>Project Brief</h2>
<p>Lead the production of a concept gas flow meter to be sold as an accessory for calibrating critical care medical devices in the field. Combine an off-the-shelf mass flow sensor with an LED display and a pressure sensor to provide full functionality whist outperforming competitor devices whilst retailing at a vastly cheaper price point. </p>

            <h2>Proof of Concept</h2>
            <p>The first step was to produce a functional prototype utilising the intended hardware and sensors. During this phase the initial code was produced, hardware choices were finalised and tests were run comparing the industry standard device to this proof of concept to ensure the accuracy of the flow, pressure, temperature, and humidity measurements were at the standard required.</p>

            <h2>Rapid Prototyping</h2>
            <p>With the components finalised I began designing and modelling concepts for the housing, each considering the assembly process, aesthetics, usability, and issues specific to injection moulding such as where split lines would be situated. To keep production costs low each housing was designed to be produced using only simple two-part mould tools, without any cores or side actions.</p>
            <p>3D printing proved invaluable in this process, allowing quick production of concepts which could be handled, examined and critiqued in the iterative process of design.</p>

            <h2>Keeping Costs Low</h2>
            <p>With price being a key element of this product every effort was made to keep potential manufacturing costs low. The housings incorporated a medical connector and a button both taken from other products in the company’s roster to benefit from economies of scale. Should the product go to manufacture these components could be produced in the devices colour scheme using the same pre-existing mould tooling.</p>

            <h2>Custom Electronics</h2>
            <p>Working with the electrical engineering team the components were condensed onto a custom PCB and work began on the code and user interface. The device used a single button to cycle between Flow Rate, Temperature, Humidity, Pressure, and a summary screen displaying all four measurements, as well as the ability to begin data logging to a microSD card.</p>
